Dependency Upgrades

Please do not open a pull request for a dependency upgrade. We have a Dependabot for such upgrades
that we prefer to use. However, if the upgrade is more involved (such as requiring
changes for removed or deprecated API) your pull request is welcome.

If, having reviewed the notes above, you're ready to submit your pull request, please
provide a description of the proposed changes. If they fix a bug, please
describe the broken behaviour and how the changes fix it. If they make an enhancement,
please describe the new functionality and why you believe it's useful. If your pull
request relates to any existing issues, please reference them by using the issue number
prefixed with #.
